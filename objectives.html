        A network security specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring information confidentiality, integrity
        and availability.
        Network security utilizes proactive techniques, including defense-in-depth and layered security, to mitigate or
        eliminate
        vulnerabilities in information systems and to protect against potential exploitation. This may include network
        and application
        penetration testing, software and hardware reverse engineering as well as developing exploits for identified
        vulnerabilities.
        Security professionals possess intimate knowledge of critical business components. The Network Security degree
        reflects the
        application of theory and is aligned with industry standards and guidelines. It provides students with the
        opportunity to
        synthesize and apply the vital skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the cyber security workforce.
